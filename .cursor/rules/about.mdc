# project

## key files
- package.json
- build.ts (main build script)
- src/extension.ts


## example terminal commands

```zsh
# invoking `tsx`:
pnpm tsx ...  # correct
tsx ...       # ERROR - DON'T USE - `tsx` is not on PATH
```

commands that run or may run forever must be called with a timeout:
```zsh
timeout -v 4 <may-run-forever-command>

# `timeout` is available on PATH:
timeout --version|head -n1
  # "timeout (GNU coreutils) 9.7"
```
